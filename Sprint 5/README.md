# Overview
The goal of this of this website was to create a replacement for the chrome homepage and replace it with the weather, a hello message, and a row of goal boxes to be checked off as tasks are completed.

This software system allows a user to view the weather, view a random quote on the bottom of the screen, and check and uncheck the goal checkboxes (more to be implemented in the future.) 

I wrote this because I struggle to manage my goals and I'd love to have an interactive replacement for the home screen with goals, a welcome message, etc.
