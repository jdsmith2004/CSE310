# Overview
The goal of this sign in page was to create a user authentication system with firebase and log the user's information to the terminal.

This software system allows a user to sign-up or sign-in to a website and uses firebase auth to connect the forms information with the cloud and log the users information to the console.

I wrote this as the first page of my website in order to have a way to track users and save their settings to the cloud.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
